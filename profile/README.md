# Agrotech_ASE_Project

A project based on smart garden automation that was developed using the full Software Development Lifecycle using the incremental waterfall methodology and utilizing the concepts of software engineering such as requirement gathering, specifications, software design and architecture, implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance.

The project has the features of smart garden such as Drip Irrigation for watering the plants, Pesticide for protecting the plants and green house to grow delecate plants. The soil moisture is measured using soil moisture sensor for drip irrigation. The pesticide level can be measured using soil NPK sensor. The green house has safety features such as temperature control, exhaust and smoke detector in case of any fire or disaster.

The following video demonstrates the working of smart garden with all the three functionalities integrated in a green house protoype:
